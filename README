DESCRIPTION
-----------

This distribution provides a Perl interface to allow reading and writing of
compressed data created with the zlib and bzip2.

IO-Compress supports reading and writing of the following compressed data formats
  * bzip2
  * RFC 1950
  * RFC 1951
  * RFC 1952 (i.e. gzip)
  * zip

There are a number of companion modules for IO-Compress that extend
the suite of compression formats available.

 * IO-Compress-Zstd
   Adds support for zstd (Zstandard).
 * IO-Compress-Lzma
   Adds support for lzma, xz and lzip.
 * IO-Compress-Lzf
   Adds support for lzf.
 * IO-Compress-Lzop
   Adds support for lzop.

Note that the following modules used to be distributed separately, but are now
included with the IO-Compress distribution.

    Compress-Zlib
    IO-Compress-Zlib
    IO-Compress-Bzip2
    IO-Compress-Base

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before you can build IO-Compress you need to have the following
installed on your system:

    * Perl 5.006 or better.
    * Compress::Raw::Zlib
    * Compress::Raw::Bzip2

BUILDING THE MODULE
-------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, the module can now be built
using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

INSTALLATION

FEEDBACK
--------

How to report a problem with IO-Compress.

To help me help you, I need all of the following information:

 1. The Versions of everything relevant.
    This includes:

     a. The *complete* output from running this

            perl -V

        Do not edit the output in any way.
        Note, I want you to run "perl -V" and NOT "perl -v".

        If your perl does not understand the "-V" option it is too
        old. This module needs Perl version 5.004 or better.

     b. The version of IO-Compress you have.
        If you have successfully installed IO-Compress, this one-liner
        will tell you:

           perl -MIO::Compress::Gzip -e 'print qq[ver $IO::Compress::Gzip::VERSION\n]'

        If you are  running windows use this

           perl -MIO::Compress::Gzip -e "print qq[ver $IO::Compress::Gzip::VERSION\n]"

        If you haven't installed IO-Compress then search IO::Compress::Gzip.pm
        for a line like this:

          $VERSION = "2.214" ;

 2. If you are having problems building IO-Compress, send me a
    complete log of what happened. Start by unpacking the IO-Compress
    module into a fresh directory and keep a log of all the steps, including
    the setting of configuration environment variables (if applicable).

        [edit config.in or set environment varialbes, if necessary]
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
