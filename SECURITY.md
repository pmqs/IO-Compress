# Security Policy for the IO::Compress distribution.

This is the Security Policy for IO::Compress.

Security vulnerabilities can be reported via the project GitHub repository
[Security Advisories](https://github.com/pmqs/IO-Compress/security/advisories).
(If you do not have access to GitHub, then you can report issues via email
to <pmqs@cpan.org>.)

The latest version of the Security Policy can be found in the
[git repository for IO::Compress](https://github.com/pmqs/IO-Compress/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

This text is based on the CPAN Security Group's Guidelines for Adding
a Security Policy to Perl Distributions (version 1.3.0)
https://security.metacpan.org/docs/guides/security-policy-for-authors.html

# How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities can be reported via the project GitHub repository
[Security Advisories](https://github.com/pmqs/IO-Compress/security/advisories).
On the “Advisories” page you can click on the “Report a vulnerability”
button. (If you do not have access to GitHub, then you can report issues
via email to <pmqs@cpan.org>.)

Please include as many details as possible, including code samples or test
cases, so that we can reproduce the issue.  Check that your report does not
expose any sensitive data, such as passwords, tokens, or personal
information.

If you would like any help with triaging the issue, or if the issue is
being actively exploited, please copy the report to the CPAN Security Group
(CPANSec) at <cpan-security@security.metacpan.org>.

Please *do not* use the public issue reporting system on RT or GitHub
issues for reporting security vulnerabilities.

Please do not disclose the security vulnerability in public forums until
past any proposed date for public disclosure, or it has been made public by
the maintainers or CPANSec.  That includes patches or pull requests.

For more information, see [Report a Security
Issue](https://security.metacpan.org/docs/report.html) on the CPANSec
website.

## Response to Reports

The maintainer(s) aim to acknowledge your security report as soon as
possible.  However, this project is maintained by a single person in their
spare time, and they cannot guarantee a rapid response.  If you have not
received a response from them within 7 days, then please send a reminder to
them and copy the report to CPANSec at <cpan-security@security.metacpan.org>.

Please note that the initial response to your report will be an
acknowledgement, with a possible query for more information.  It will not
necessarily include any fixes for the issue.

The project maintainer(s) may forward this issue to the security contacts
for other projects where we believe it is relevant.  This may include
embedded libraries, system libraries, prerequisite modules or downstream
software that uses this software.

They may also forward this issue to CPANSec.

# Which Software This Policy Applies To

Any security vulnerabilities in IO::Compress are covered by this policy.

Security vulnerabilities in versions of any libraries that are
included in IO::Compress are also covered by this policy.

Security vulnerabilities are considered anything that allows users
to execute unauthorised code, access unauthorised resources, or to
have an adverse impact on accessibility or performance of a system.

Security vulnerabilities in upstream software (prerequisite modules
or system libraries, or in Perl), are not covered by this policy
unless they affect IO::Compress, or IO::Compress can
be used to exploit vulnerabilities in them.

Security vulnerabilities in downstream software (any software that
uses IO::Compress, or plugins to it that are not included with the
IO::Compress distribution) are not covered by this policy.

## Supported Versions of IO::Compress

The maintainer(s) will only commit to releasing security fixes for
the latest version of IO::Compress.

Note that the IO::Compress project only supports major versions of
Perl since 5.8, even though IO::Compress will run on older versions
of Perl. If a security fix requires us to increase the minimum version of
Perl that is supported, then we may do so.

# Installation and Usage Issues

The distribution metadata specifies minimum versions of prerequisites that
are required for IO::Compress to work.  However, some of these
prerequisites may have security vulnerabilities, and you should ensure that
you are using up-to-date versions of these prerequisites.

Where security vulnerabilities are known, the metadata may indicate newer
versions as recommended.

## Usage

Please see the software documentation for further information.
